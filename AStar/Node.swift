/**
 * Node represents a point on a path. It is an end point that has one or more paths connected to it. Start and End are 
 * nodes, as are any points that you may pass through in between.
 *
 * In a real application, this class will need to be sub-classed to provide the means of handling application unique 
 * features of the Node. One such feature is the means of calculating the heuristic cost to get to the end point.
